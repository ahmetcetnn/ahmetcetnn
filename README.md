      #  Hi, My name is Ahmet Cetin
      ##  Jr. Front End Developer
  ***      I am a junior Front-End Developer with a background in law. With the desire to develop and deepen my knowledge on web development, I quit my job as a lawyer and started working full-time in this field, while also taking courses. I started the Frontend Path on Scrimba and am currently developing projects with React.js. While aiming to learn a new concept in each of my projects, I am creating areas where I can progress on Firebase Redux and Tailwind and pushing myself for more. The only thing I can offer is my ability to learn quickly and to deliver what is asked of me on time, regardless of the cost. ***
