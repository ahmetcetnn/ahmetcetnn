# Hi, My name is Ahmet Cetin






## Front-End Developer

 I started my software development career within the JavaScript ecosystem and gradually specialized in React, React Native, and Next.js technologies. Throughout my 3 years of professional experience, I have developed scalable B2B applications, continuously improving myself in user experience, performance, and sustainable architecture.

On the frontend side, I have built visually appealing and highly functional user interfaces using modern UI libraries such as Ant Design, ShadCN, and Tailwind CSS. On the mobile side, I have developed React Native projects within the Expo Go environment, delivering applications that run smoothly on both iOS and Android platforms. During this process, I gained hands-on experience in mobile performance optimization, push notification integrations, API management, and designing in-app user flows.

Additionally, I have worked with WordPress and Shopify platforms, focusing on SEO optimization, theme customization, and general site maintenance, allowing me to be productive across different technology ecosystems. I am always eager to learn new technologies, follow modern software trends, and build user-centered solutions.
